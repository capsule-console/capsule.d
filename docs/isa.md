# Capsule Instruction Set Architecture

This document provides an exhaustive explanation of the Capsule instruction
set architecture (ISA) and all of its supported opcodes.

For a more concise summary of instructions, please refer to the
[Capsule Assembly Instruction Listing](./instructions.md).

Here is a very quick overview:

- Instructions are 32 bits long, and must be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
- Opcodes are 7 bits long.
- Immediate values are 16 bits long, and they are always sign-extended
rather than zero-extended.
- Registers contain 32-bit integers.
- There are 7 general-purpose registers and a hard-wired zero register.
- Addressable memory can contain up to 2,147,483,648 bytes, or approximately 2 gigabytes.

Please note these common abbreviations:

- **rd**, meaning _destination register_, or the register to which the
output of an operation is written.
- **rs1**, meaning the _first source register_, or the first register from
which the input for an operation is read.
- **rs2**, meaning the _second source register_, or the second register from
which the input for an operation is read.
- **i32**, meaning an instruction's _immediate value_, sign-extended from
16 bits to 32 bits.
- **pc**, meaning the _program counter_. Also called an instruction pointer.

## Encoding

All Capsule bytecode instructions are represented with a 32-bit word
and should be represented in
[little endian order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)
when encoded in a binary format.
In compiled bytecode, instructions must always fall on a 32-bit
word boundary in memory in order to be executable.

There is only one instruction format, i.e. the same information about
an instruction always occupies the same span of bits for every opcode.

The opcode always occupies the lowest 7 bits, the destination register
the next 3 bits, the first source register the 3 bits after that,
the second source register a subsequent 3 bits, and an immediate value
occupies the highest 16 bits.

``` text
| 00 .. 07 | 07 .. 10 | 10 .. 13 | 13 .. 16 | 16 .. 32  |
| opcode   | rd       | rs1      | rs2      | immediate |
```

## Registers

There are eight registers that an instruction may operate upon, not counting
the _pc_, or program counter, which may be manipulated by jump and branch
instructions or accessed via the _auipc_ instruction.

Register 0, or _Z_, is a hard-wired zero register. When used for an instruction's
_rs1_ (first source register) or _rs2_ (second source register), it always
produces a value of 0. When used for an instruction's _rd_ (destination register),
it means that the output is discarded and is not written to any register.

The remaining registers 1 through 7 are general-purpose registers. They may
be given special meanings by an ABI or calling conventions, but the ISA itself
imposes no conventions or restrictions upon their usage.

The register names are, in order: Z, A, B, C, R, S, X, Y.

## Exceptions

Some instructions may produce an exception under certain circumstances.

As of writing, exceptions are always and immediately fatal to a Capsule program.
There is no way to recover from an exception.
In the future, there may be some facility to handle and recover from exceptions.

There are 127 possible exception codes, not counting the exception code used to
represent an absent or missing exception (0x00).
Currently, only fifteen of these codes have been assigned a meaning.
Only eleven of these codes are currently possible to trigger.

- **triple (0x01)** - Not currently used. This exception is reserved to
represent a triple fault, to be triggered if an exception occurs while
handling a double fault exception.

- **double (0x02)** - Not currently used. This exception is reserved to
represent a double fault, to be triggered if an exception occurs while
handling another exception.

- **instr (0x03)** - This exception is triggered when the virtual machine
encounters an unrecognized or invalid instruction.

- **pcexec (0x04)** - This exception is triggered when the program counter is
found to be in non-executable memory, i.e. outside the _text_ segment.

- **lalign (0x05)** - This exception is triggered upon attempting to load
a half word from an address not aligned on a 16 bit boundary,
or upon attempting to load a word from an address that is not aligned
on a 32 bit boundary.

- **salign (0x06)** - This exception is triggered upon attempting to store
a half word to an address not aligned on a 16 bit boundary,
or upon attempting to store a word to an address that is not aligned
on a 32 bit boundary.

- **pcalign (0x07)** - This exception is triggered when the program counter
is found to not be aligned on a 32-bit word boundary.

- **lbounds (0x08)** - This exception is triggered when attempting to load
from an address that is not within valid addressable memory, e.g. because
the signed address is less than zero or because it exceeds the length of
the program's memory.

- **sbounds (0x09)** - This exception is triggered when attempting to store
to an address that is not within valid addressable memory, e.g. because
the signed address is less than zero or because it exceeds the length of
the program's memory.

- **pcbounds (0x0a)** - This exception is triggered when the program counter
is found to not be within valid addressable memory, e.g. because
the signed address is less than zero or because it exceeds the length of
the program's memory.

- **sro (0x0b)** - This exception is triggered when attempting to store
to a read-only location in memory, such as to an address within the
program's _text_ or _rodata_ segment.

- **ovf (0x0c)** - Not currently used. This exception is reserved to
represent arithmetic overflow.

- **divz (0x0d)** - Not currently used. This exception is reserved to
represent an integer divison by zero.

- **extmiss (0x0e)** - This exception is triggered by the _ecall_ instruction
when the given extension ID value is unknown or unsupported by the VM
implementation.

- **exterr (0x0f)** - This exception may be triggered by the _ecall_
instruction, depending on the extension, to signal some kind of error or
invalid state detected while calling that extension.

_rs2_ and _i32_. The value of _rs1_ may be treated as an input, depending
on the extension.

Attempting to call an extension which is not supported by the implementation
will trigger an _extmiss_ exception (0x0e).
Note that the _meta.check_ext_ extension (0x00000003) should be provided
by every implementation to check whether an extension ID is supported or not.

Called extensions may trigger an _exterr_ exception (0x0f) if they were
used in an unsupported or invalid manner.
